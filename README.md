# UAH Calibration for Differential Robots

We have written a Python script that automatically calibrates the needed data to compute the position of the robot through odometry.

This software has been written as part of the **Padrino Tecnológico** initiative from the *University of Alcalá, Spain*.

The theory behind the methods we propose can be found over at [**Hindawi's Journal of Sensors**](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/8269256/?utm_medium=author&utm_source=Hindawi).

## Rough Theoretical Summary

The main approach for differential robot location has traditionally been odometry. As we "know" the diameter of our wheels and the number of revolutions they turn we can theoretically compute the linear displacement of the robot as well as the final direction it's heading. The "bad thing" is that our errors will be cumulative, meaning that after a few meters our estimation of the position will be practically worthless.

This deviation is due to both systematic and non-systematic errors:

* **Systematic errors**: They are due to the characteristics of the robot itself and will (usually) remain constant through a robot's lifespan.

* **Non-systematic errors**: They are caused by he interaction of our robot with the medium. Examples are wheel slippage when going through a slippery area or unpredictable non-plain terrain.
