# UAH Calibration for Differential Robots

We have written a Python script that automatically calibrates the needed data to compute the position of the robot through odometry.

This software has been written as part of the **Padrino Tecnológico** initiative from the *University of Alcalá, Spain*.

The theory behind the methods we propose can be found over at [**Hindawi's Journal of Sensors**](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/8269256/?utm_medium=author&utm_source=Hindawi)
